# Intro To Linux

## TryHackMe has a great guide on how to get started with Linux

First you are going to need to make an account which you can make at [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/).

Afterwards you are going to go to the [room](https://tryhackme.com/room/linuxfundamentalspart1) as tryhackme calls them and it will guide you all the way to the end of your Linux Fundamentals journey. 

Linux is interesting, because it alone is not an operating system, but a term describing the many variations, called distributions. The reasons these distributions exist are because Linux is open source and anyone has the ability to create changes. That's why it's everywhere from refrigerators to the world's largest servers. I wish you the full power of computer hardware, and I grant you Linux which is close enough.

Below is the video guide tryhackme created so you can watch it right here.
