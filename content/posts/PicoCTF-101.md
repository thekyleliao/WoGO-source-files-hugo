# Welcome to PicoCTF!

## This is a pseudo-guide to getting started! Kyle Liao is an avid PicoCTF beginner and will help you through this.

First you are going to make an account with picoCTF. picoCTF is a website run by CMU(Carnegie Mellon University), displaying CTFs(capture the flags). Capture the Flags are cybersecurity challenges where one at the low level, you get information then use a cybersecurity technique to get a flag(information in a certain unique format often hidden inside the info). For picoCTF, flags are picoCTF{flag}, meaning that the flag is any kind of text between the brackets. I didn't understand this at the beginning and just put random words inside the answer box.

So well, get to it. [PicoCTF](https://www.picoctf.org/). You are going to want to go to PicoGYM which is their practice mode, the non-competition version of the game. You may want to read [picoPrimer](https://primer.picoctf.com/) which is like a couple of textbook pages with general info to help you. My opinion, just follow along to Martin Carlise in this [youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJ_vkrXdcgH-mAfYXdzFSEu_t7Fmhsplc). Use his strategies along with the webshell, a CLI virtual machine, to find the solutions to problems.

**You won't be able to solve all of the problems**. You might not have the tools needed, or the knowledge, or patience. Just try your best. Google everything. Use the hints. You will learn something, be it a new tool, new people, a new field, anything. It's challenging, but fun.
