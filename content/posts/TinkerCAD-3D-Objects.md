# Welcome to TinkerCAD.

## TinkerCAD is a browser based CAD solution. It’s owned by AutoCAD, so that might ring a few bells. We also mention it earlier with the circuit simulator they have(my opinion being that it is much cooler).

I first used TinkerCAD for 3D modeling. I never really got the hang of it, but it surely impressed teachers for school projects. I remember taking a SVG file of Alfred Nobel and imposing it over a coin making my own “Nobel prize coin”. It looked awful, but it was a good waste of time that eventually got me to 3D printing. 3D print of fun sized objects like whistles, and other trinkets. It’s an interesting skill to have.

The below video will help you get started.

You are going to need an account, pretty straightforward. Afterwards you are going to follow the video as it guides you through how to move the things around. The comment section of the video seems to have some great tips. A mouse is helpful because you can use right click to spin your object around, but the web app works without the mouse. With some skills maybe you can make a statue of Alfred Nobel, instead of just a coin. **Happy CADing!**

**Seems someone else made a coin too**.
