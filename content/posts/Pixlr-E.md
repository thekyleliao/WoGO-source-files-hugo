# Pixlr. Ever heard of it? It’s an online browser based way to do raster based editing of photos.

#  It’s useful. Take advantage. Combine it with Canva and you can make great things. Or just funny faces of your friends. Either or.

Pixlr is very similar to other Raster Layer Based editors you might know, like GIMP(funny name I know), and the almighty photoshop. I started using photo editors beginning with Pixlr. Before it got its fancy new website. The E version is the one that has the more traditional tools of a photo editor. You will find it [here](https://pixlr.com/e/#home).

Below it's a great guide and a plus is the narrator has a great accent.

In general, pixlr and other editors work in layers. You have the base layer and you stack layers of images on top. To do this you use .png files which can have transparent portions. I’m not an artist so I can’t tell you the artsy parts of Pixlr, but all I’m saying is if in doubt just take a photo of your buddies and use the burn and smudge tools. **Have fun!**
