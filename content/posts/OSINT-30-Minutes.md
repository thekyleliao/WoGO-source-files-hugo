Above we have a video detailing the use of the OSINT framework. OSINT stands for **Open Source Intelligence**. 

The “Wii Suck” team for HSIO 2022, consisting of Kyle, Nandini, Yash, and Hosong. We did OSINT research on a particular individual who randomly happened to be a part of the hackathon and managed to find enough information to stage a potential social engineering attack.

In 30 minutes, you will learn from the video the various tools needed to gather information online. You will use the variety of tools to find information using the info you already have. Just follow the framework and the video. You start with one piece of information and you slowly gather more using the tools. With your witts you will be able to be in the shoes of the hacker trying to learn more about their target. We enjoyed trying to find out stuff about random people. We hope you do too. 


**Don’t do anything illegal**.
