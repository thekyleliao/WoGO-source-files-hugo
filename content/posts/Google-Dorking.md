# TryHackMe and Kyle help you with Google Dorking

## Google Dorking is using the google search engine and specific search queries in order to get information that wasn’t meant to be indexed by google.

First, you are going to want to make an account on [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/). 

TryHackMe has a video guide for its own room so you can be guided step by step through its questions. It’s why I like TryHackMe. It has a lot of handholding for topics I don’t understand. The site has a lot of instructions that should help you so there isn’t much for me to say. Google Dorking can be done by anyone since it's just using search queries. There are plenty of [cheat sheets](https://gbhackers.com/latest-google-dorks-list/). TryHackMe is a great resource for beginner cybersecurity and I’m still learning myself. If you don’t have time to play through the actual TryHackMe room go ahead and watch the video. It’s good by itself. Who knows, after you learn how to do it, maybe you can find the long lost fountain of youth on the internet.
