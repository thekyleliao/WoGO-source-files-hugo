# Intro to Excel

Excel is a Microsoft-developed spreadsheet software. It can store data, create graphs, and show trends in data, and has many applications in [data science](https://towardsdatascience.com/excel-for-data-science-a82247670d7a). Some useful tools include the = function, which allows you to set the value of a cell based on the value stored in another cell. So for example, you can put 4 in A1 and then set B1 as =A1*3. B1 will now be 12. If you change A1 to 2, B1 will now be 6.

Another useful feature is shown in this video below. Excel can recognize patterns in your data, and if you highlight the pattern and extend it, it can automatically fill in cells with values.

Lastly, Excel has a very cool tool called Analyze. It can be used to find specific trends, suggest how to sort the data, and show summary statistics. More information about it can be found [here](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/analyze-data-in-excel-3223aab8-f543-4fda-85ed-76bb0295ffc4#:~:text=Simply%20select%20a%20cell%20in,it%20in%20a%20task%20pane.).
