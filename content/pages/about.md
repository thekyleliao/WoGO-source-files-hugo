# About

According to [K-12 Drive](https://www.k12dive.com/news/report-more-high-schools-offer-computer-science-courses-but-enrollment-di/609890/#:~:text=The%20report%20found%20that%20in,in%20a%20computer%20science%20course.), only about 4.7 percent of students nationally take computer science courses. Why? Maybe because only 51% of schools offer a computer science curriculum. 51%. Barely half.

We have become increasingly aware that we are incredibly fortunate to have the opportunity to study computer science. Others do not have the same opportunities we have. Some simply do not have access to the curriculum, some are too busy to fit in a CS course, or some are simply very confused and don't know where to start. No matter what your reason is, here at WoGO, we have decided to make a website with the resources we wish we had when we first started programming. Included here are YouTube videos, project ideas, information about different technological fields, and so much more. Our site offers hours of content and we offer tutorials on subjects like Python to OSINT to TinkerCAD. Each lesson is designed to be completed in anywhere from 10 - 30 minutes. All you need is an internet-enabled device and a desire to learn. They can be completed while on the bus, in between classes, or whenever you have free time. These lessons are meant to be easy, flexible projects that push you to learn more.

 Our website will not have everything needed, though. And thatâ€™s okay. Because we hope that with this website, we can inspire a new generation of people to take matters in their own hands and develop a passion for computer science. 

We encourage visitors to delve deeper into this mysterious, exciting new world. Resources like [Codeacademy](https://www.codecademy.com/), [picoCTF](https://www.picoctf.org/), and [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/)
